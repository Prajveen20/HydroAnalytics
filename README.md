Entering or exiting defined geofences

Proximity to high-risk zones or custom-defined areas

Real-time tracking and live alerting for emergency response or location-sensitive applications

üîß Features:
Real-time alert generation from live latitude/longitude streams

Customizable geofence and threshold configurations

Integration-ready for webhooks, SMS, email, or push notifications

Scalable design using modern frameworks and APIs
